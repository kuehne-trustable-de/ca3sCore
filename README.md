# ca3s

## Mission

ca3s is a CA support system with a flexible RA part using BPM aiming to automate as much as possible to offer a full certificate management system.
Therefore providing ACME and SCEP interfaces in addition to the usual web form. Aggregating certificate sets
from different sources and using CMP-connected CAs or ADCS instances for certificate creation.

### The feature list

- Manage all your CA instances (CMP and ADCS)

- Keep track of expiration of all your relevant certificates from all sources

- Analyze the key algorithms, key length, hash and padding algorithms in use

- Offer a convenient web interface for the requestors and the RA officers

- Use of the <a href="https://badkeys.info/">badkeys</a> project (if installed locally) to check keys for known weaknesses
 

And most important for a reliable PKI infrastructure:

- Automate issuance and renewal as far as possible

- Use BPMN to define organization specific rules

- Offer well established interfaces (ACME and SCEP) for easy automation

## Installation

For a quick start there are ready-build package available at [maven central](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/de.trustable.ca3s.core/ca-3-s). Just download the latest version.
Install a recent version of the Java runtime (Version >= 11) and run

    java -jar .\target\ca-3-s-{version}.jar

This command starts a ca3s instance with a local h2 database and it's web interface available at http://localhost:8080

You can login with e.g. user/user or admin/admin to get a first impression.

### Configuration

For a more useful setup you need to setup a database (or use a schema in an existing database) and insert the corresponding setting in a configuration file. A convenient way is to make a copy of
/src/main/resources/config/application-prod.xml to your application directory. Check the settings in this configuration file and adapt it where required (e.g. the database settings).

    java -jar .\target\ca-3-s-{version}.jar --spring.config.location=file://{path}/application-prod.xml

With a database configuration ca3s will create the required tables (thanks to liquibase).

## Development

This application was generated using JHipster 6.5.1, you can find documentation and help at [https://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v6.5.1](https://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v6.5.1).

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

    npm install

We use npm scripts and [Webpack][] as our build system.

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

    ./mvnw
    npm start

Npm is also used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in [package.json](package.json). You can also run `npm update` and `npm install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `help` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `npm help update`.

The `npm run` command will list all of the scripts available to run for this project.

### Using vue-cli

You can also use [Vue CLI][] to display the project using vue UI.

For example, the following command:

    vue ui

will generate open Vue Project Manager. From there, you'll be able to manage your project as any other Vue.js projects.

## Building for production

### Packaging as jar

To build the final jar and optimize the ca3s application for production, run:

    ./mvnw -Pprod clean verify

This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.
To ensure everything worked, run:

    java -jar target/*.jar

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

Refer to [Using JHipster in production][] for more details.

### Packaging as war

To package your application as a war in order to deploy it to an application server, run:

    ./mvnw -Pprod,war clean verify

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:
```
./mvnw verify
```

### Tested and supported Certification Authorites
ca3s was tested and supports the following Certification Authorities:
* EJBCA (via CMP)
* ADCS - Windows CA (via [ADCSproxy](https://github.com/kuehne-trustable-de/adcsCert/tree/master/adcsProxy))
* xipki (via CMP)

In general all Certification Authorities are supported that proviedes a CMP endpoint.


### Client tests

Unit tests are run by [Jest][] and written with [Jasmine][]. They're located in [src/test/javascript/](src/test/javascript/) and can be run with:
npm test

For more information, refer to the [Running tests page][].

### Code quality

Sonar is used to analyse code quality. You can start a local Sonar server (accessible on http://localhost:9001) with:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/sonar.yml up -d
```

You can run a Sonar analysis with using the [sonar-scanner](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner) or by using the maven plugin.
Then, run a Sonar analysis:

```
./mvnw -Pprod clean verify sonar:sonar
```

If you need to re-run the Sonar phase, please be sure to specify at least the `initialize` phase since Sonar properties are loaded from the sonar-project.properties file.

```
./mvnw initialize sonar:sonar
```

or
For more information, refer to the [Code quality page][].

## Tooling

We are using IntelliJ IDEA. Many thanks to [JetBrain's open source support](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/opensource/#support) !

## Continuous Integration (optional)

To configure CI for your project, run the ci-cd sub-generator (`jhipster ci-cd`), this will let you generate configuration files for a number of Continuous Integration systems. Consult the [Setting up Continuous Integration][] page for more information.
